Folder Structure Conventions
============================

> Folder structure options and naming conventions for software projects

### A typical top-level directory layout

    .
    ├── build                   # Compiled files (alternatively `dist`)
    ├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
    ├── src                     # Source files (alternatively `lib` or `app`)
    ├── test                    # Automated tests (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
    ├── tools                   # Tools and utilities
	├── libraries               # External libraries (alternatively `dep`)
    ├── LICENCE
    ├── AUTHORS                 # List of authors
    └── README.md

> Use short lowercase names at least for the top-level files and folders except
> `LICENCE`, `AUTHORS`, `README.md`

### Source files

    .
    ├── src                     # Source files
	├── include             # (public) header files [optional]
	├── ...

The actual source files of a software project are usually stored inside the
`src` folder. Alternatively, you can put them into the `lib` (if you're
developing a library), or into the `app` folder (if your application's source
files are not supposed to be compiled). You may want to put all the headers
that expose public functions of the module in a directory apart (`include`).

### Automated tests

Automated tests are usually placed into the `test` or, less commonly, into the `spec` or `tests` folder.

> **Q: Why tests are placed into a separate folder, as opposed to having them closer to the code under test?**
>
> **A:** Because you don't want to test the code, you want to test the *program*.

### Documentation files

Often it is beneficial to include some reference data into the project, such as
Rich Text Format (RTF) documentation, which is usually stored into the `docs`
or, less commonly, into the `doc` folder.

    .
    ├── ...
    ├── docs                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
    │   ├── TOC.md              # Table of contents
    │   ├── faq.md              # Frequently asked questions
    │   ├── misc.md             # Miscellaneous information
    │   ├── usage.md            # Getting started guide
    │   └── ...                 # etc.
    └── ...

### Compiled files

It's often useful to keep any built files completely separate from the source files; the directory usually meant to fulfill this is the `build` directory (or, less commonly, the `dist` directory). Separate build directories are used to hold the built objects files, libraries, and executable programs, etc. for a specific flavor of build. In addition to that, having a dedicated folder for built files makes easier to write targets to clean the workspace in your makefile, without the need to change directory or use regular expression to delete only a certain subset of files. Needless to say, this folder is always initially empty in a cleaned workspace.

### 3rd party libraries

	.
    ├── ...
    ├── libraries             # 3rd party dependencies
    │   ├── lib1              # A library
    │   │   ├── include       # header files in `include path`
	│   │   └── lib           # actual static/dynamic library (.a, .so, .dll ...)
    │   ├── lib2              # Another library
    │   └── ...               # etc.
    └── ...

As discussed in [this article](http://www.lonecpluspluscoder.com/2014/12/03/managing-third-party-libraries-c-projects/), there are basically three way to manage external libraries:

 - by letting the developers download and install the libraries themselves
 - by checking third party libraries into the version control repository
 - by using a package management tool (Maven, npm, ...)

If opting for the second, libraries are supposed to go under the `libraries` directory; this is to avoid having ambiguous name with `lib`, see **Source files** above.

### List of authors

Report every author in the `AUTHORS` file, one line per author, in mailmap format. For instance:

```
Jon Doe <Jon.Doe@company.com> jdoe <jdoe@somemail.com>
```

In this example both a real name and an optional alias are specified.

### Licence information

If you want to share your work with others, please consider choosing an open
source licence and include the text of the licence into your project.
The text of a licence is usually stored in the `LICENCE` (or `LICENCE.txt`,
`LICENCE.md`) file in the root of the project.

> You’re under no obligation to choose a licence and it’s your right not to
> include one with your code or project. But please note that opting out of
> open source licences doesn’t mean you’re opting out of copyright law.
> 
> You’ll have to check with your own legal counsel regarding your particular
> project, but generally speaking, the absence of a licence means that default
> copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source
> code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative
> works from your work. This might not be what you intend.
>
> Even in the absence of a licence file, you may grant some rights in cases
> where you publish your source code to a site that requires accepting terms
> of service. For example, if you publish your source code in a public
> repository on GitHub, you have accepted the [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service)
> which do allow other GitHub users some rights. Specifically, you allow others
> to view and fork your repository.
